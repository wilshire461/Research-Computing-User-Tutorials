## Filesystems

All users are allocated space on the `/home` and `/projects`
filesystems. In addition, separate `scratch` directories are visible
from Summit and Blanca. These scratch directories are hosted on
separate, high-performance filesystems designed to support intensive,
parallel I/O operations.

Please note that the use of `/home` or `/projects` for
high-performance I/O may negatively affect the environment for all
users. As a result, all compute jobs should write to the appropriate
`scratch` filesystem. **Users performing intensive I/O on the `/home`
or `/projects` filesystems will have their jobs terminated and may
have their accounts temporarily disabled.**


### The Home Filesystem

Every user is allocated 2 GB of space on the `/home` filesystem in a
subdirectory corresponding to their user name (e.g., `/home/janedoe`).
Home directories are [backed up frequently](#backups) and
are intended for the use of their owner only; sharing the contents of
home directories with other users is strongly discouraged. Your
`/home` directory is a good place to store source code, small compiled
programs, and job scripts.


### The Projects Filesystem

Each user has access to a 250 GB of space in their subdirectory of
`/projects` (e.g., `/projects/janedoe`). As with the `/home` system,
these directories are visible from all Research Computing nodes and
are regularly backed up. The projects directory is intended to store
software builds and smaller data sets.


### Scratch Filesystems

Summit users are provided a subdirectory on `/scratch/summit`, the
high-performance parallel scratch filesystem meant for I/O from jobs
running on that system (e.g., `/scratch/summit/janedoe`). By default,
each user is limited to a quota of 10 TB worth of storage space and
20M files and directories. Email rc-help@colorado.edu if you need
these limits increased. Blanca users should write to
`/rc_scratch/janedoe` instead of `/scratch/summit`.

Scratch space should be used for all compute jobs run on Summit or
Blanca. These high-performance scratch directories are **not backed
up**, and are not appropriate for long-term storage. Data may be
purged at any time subject to overall system needs. Files are
automatically removed 90 days after their initial creation.

Users requiring longer-term retention of their files should perform
regular backups to their local machine if they have not purchased
space on the [PetaLibrary](petalibrary.html). Inappropriate use of scratch
storage, including attempts to circumvent the automatic file purge
policy, may result in loss of access to Research Computing resources.


### Monitoring Disk Usage

Disk usage may be checked using the `curc-quota` command. When run
from a Summit `compile node`, you will see output similar to:

```
[janedoe@shas0136 ~]$ curc-quota
------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                       Used         Avail    Quota Limit
------------------------------------------------------------------------
/home/janedoe                          1.7G          339M           2.0G
/projects/janedoe                       67G          184G           250G
/scratch/summit                         29G        10211G         10240G
```

If the command is run from a `login node`, information concerning
/scratch/summit will be omitted.

Note that the space occupied by a particular directory and its
subdirectories can be obtained via the `du -h` command:

```
[janedoe@shas0136 ~]$ du -h /scratch/summit/janedoe/WRF
698M	WRF/run
698M	WRF
```


### Backups

Regular backups are performed for all `/home` and `/projects`
directories and at a range of cadences. Low-cadence backups are
retained for longer periods of time than high-cadence backups. A
summary of the backup schedule is provided in the table below.

| Filesystem        | Cadence           | Retention Period  |
| ------------- |------------:| -----:|
| `/home`       | 2 hr          |    25 hr |
| `/home`       | 1 d           |     8 d |
| `/home`       | 1 wk          |    29 d |
| `/projects`   | 6 hr          |    25 hr |
| `/projects`   | 1 d           |    8 d |
| `/projects`   | 1 wk          |   15 d |
| `/scratch`    | **no backups** | N/A |
| `/rc_scratch` | **no backups** | N/A |

If disaster strikes and you need access to a previous version of your
`/home` or `/projects` directories, change to that directory and look
through the .snapshot subdirectory. You will not be able to see the .snapshot
directory via `ls -a` but it is there. Once you have changed directory to the snapshot directory
you will see subdirectories associated with each snapshot of your `/home` or `/projects`
directory, named using the time-stamp associated with the snapshot.

### Workspace Sharing

All users have complete control over their personal directory
permissions. While we encourage you to share your `/projects` and
`/scratch` directories with collaborators as appropriate, we strongly
discourage sharing of your `/home` directory due to the limited space
and potentially sensitive information stored there.

Directories may be shared with all Research Computing users or with
only a subset of our users. In the latter case, a system
administrator will need to add your chosen collaborators to your Linux
group. Please email rc-help@colorado.edu if you would like to add
users to your Linux group.

In the example that follows, we make our `/projects` directory open to
all users and then create subdirectories with select read/write
permissions for all users and our chosen collaborators.

First, we make our `/projects` directory world-readable:

```
[janedoe@shas0136 ~]$ chmod a+rx /projects/janedoe
```

Next, we create a subdirectory that is visible to all users and which
is read-only:

```
[janedoe@shas0136 ~]$ cd /projects/janedoe
[janedoe@shas0136 ~]$ mkdir world_read
[janedoe@shas0136 ~]$ chmod a+rx world_read
```

For our collaborators, we may want a writeable directory in addition
to a read-only directory:

```
[janedoe@shas0136 ~]$ cd /projects/janedoe
[janedoe@shas0136 ~]$ mkdir group_read
[janedoe@shas0136 ~]$ chmod g+rx group_read
[janedoe@shas0136 ~]$ mkdir group_read_write
[janedoe@shas0136 ~]$ chmod g+rwx group_read_write
```

A similar methodology will need to be followed for all subdirectories
you wish to share. If you make a mistake or change your mind, use the
`-` symbol in lieu of `+` to remove privileges. Note that the `x` is
necessary if you want other users to be able to `cd` into your
directory.
